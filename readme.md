# Fabricator Mixins

While this component is designed with the [BuzzingPixel Fabricator Build Process](https://github.com/tjdraper/buzzing-pixel-fabricator) in mind, it can be used anywhere (in theory).

## Installing

With Fabricator and NPM, simply require this library into your project and restart the Fabricator Grunt build process.

`npm install fabmixins --save`

If you are not using Fabricator, you will need to include into your Less build all the mixin files in `src`.
